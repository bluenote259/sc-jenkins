  <h3>Liverpool Thrashed?</h3>
  <p>Liverpool began the game shakily to begin with. Errant midfield passes, and
    the threat of Manchester City's faster players getting in behind a rotational
    defense as Ragnar Klavan replaced Dejan Lovren at the back. It was apparent
    that Liverpool's troubles were just starting, and then calamity struck.
    A red card is Football's most egregious, and feared symbol in all of the sport,
    awarded to those considered guilty of violent conduct, sporting unfortune, and
    dangerous play.<span>The send off</span> Sadio Mane was unlucky to be sent off in my eyes;
    Ederson's head was down
    as he came into the field of play, and outside the sanctuary of the goalkeeper's box.
    My gut reaction was to leap to Mane's defense, but I can play both sides of the coin,
    and I can fantasize about a Liverpool who was threatening to score an early goal before
    Mane was sent off, and what could have been. What was truly aching was to see the reaction
    of pundits and morning (afternoon for us in America) headlines. Yes, Liverpool left the field
    dejected as a 0-5 score read on a giant monitor, seeing City fans drunk with happiness in totally
    dismantling a short-sided Reds team. Why? Because against the caliber of team that Pep Guardiola
    deploys week-after-week the game would have been difficult, and nobody expects it otherwise, but
    against a team still attacking with 10 men, well, it's a cakewalk.
    <span>The positive</span> With my rose-colored glasses, I can argue the
    plaudits that Klopp deserves for not pulling the team backwards defensively and stuffing them into
    the net, ala-Mourinho, but chasing a game that seemed lost when the team's best player was sent off.
    It shows the never-say-die attitude that Football fans crave in a manager; the reason that an offensively
    minded team will receive the accolades of progressive and 'beautiful' Football that defensive teams
    do not receive, and often are rooted against by neutral fans who want to see a competitive match.
    <span>The result</span> Mane will receive a three-game suspension, the first of which he will serve against Burnley.
    As he proved against a stingy Crystal Palace team, the cream will always rise, and he found the net by luck, and
    perseverance, and these are the games that Liverpool have trouble dominating, and as such, will be missed.
    The question of why Liverpool gave up 5 goals is not a question worth posing, and the team will bounce back behind
    a manager who wants to play the game that the players, and fans want to pay for.

</img><h3>On Coutinho</h3>
<p>No one is bigger than the club. It's
an ethos that seems to run through teams that have a hard time hiding from the
financially resolute sharks of the top leagues. When money comes calling it's hard
for players to stay away from the calling of historically rich teams that carry
fame and the promise of trophies. Neymar succumbing to a cash-rich goliath like PSG
recalculates the value that teams place on players who are essential to their teams' ambitions.
Inevitably, Coutinho will go on to Barcelona as they need to placate their fans with a signing that is viewed,
at least in terms of potential, adequate. As a player, I have no doubt that Coutinho will ensure that fans
will remain glued to their seats at the Camp Nou for years, but next year. It would be in Liverpool's best interest
to keep him for the upcoming season to ward away any regretful fans' arguments of, 'but if we had Coutinho,
Liverpool would have beaten team x.' What fans have ahead of this season, which starts this week on Saturday,
is uncertainty. Losing Liverpool's midfield gem at this moment would run Klopp's plans aground.
This season will be a measuring stick, especially in terms of value, of what Barcelona should pay for
Brazil's National team captain, and play-maker. If Neymar's mouth-dropping transfer is an outlier, or Paul Pogba's
ninety million pounds of last Summer is any indication of the trend towards unrealistic numbers,
the transfer market will take on the MLB, NHL, and NBA's overblown offseason.

  <h3>The Case for Ryan Kent</h3>
  <p>While the Footballing world got its first glimpse of speedster Ryan Kent, many around
    the Liverpool camp were already privy to his promise. A real handful running at opposition defenders,
    as evidenced by his cameos against Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid in the Audi Cup, Kent's prowess
    and straight-forward style of play can unhinge fullbacks around the planet. Already stocked with speedy
    wingers, Kent will be needed for respite for Mo Salah, and looks suitable for the job at running at players,
    and allowing Firmino, Solanke, and Origi to find space, or make runs off of them. It remains to be seen what
    capacity Jurgen Klopp will utilize young Kent, but he can be a super substitute, not unlike the under-used
    Jordan Ibe, if he continues the style of go-ahead running that Klopp implores in his attackers.
