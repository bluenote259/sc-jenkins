<h3>On Coutinho</h3>
<p>No one is bigger than the club. It's
an ethos that seems to run through teams that have a hard time hiding from the
financially resolute sharks of the top leagues. When money comes calling it's hard
for players to stay away from the calling of historically rich teams that carry
fame and the promise of trophies. Neymar succumbing to a cash-rich goliath like PSG
recalculates the value that teams place on players who are essential to their teams' ambitions.
Inevitably, Coutinho will go on to Barcelona as they need to placate their fans with a signing that is viewed,
at least in terms of potential, adequate. As a player, I have no doubt that Coutinho will ensure that fans
will remain glued to their seats at the Camp Nou for years, but next year. It would be in Liverpool's best interest
to keep him for the upcoming season to ward away any regretful fans' arguments of, 'but if we had Coutinho,
Liverpool would have beaten team x.' What fans have ahead of this season, which starts this week on Saturday,
is uncertainty. Losing Liverpool's midfield gem at this moment would run Klopp's plans aground.
This season will be a measuring stick, especially in terms of value, of what Barcelona should pay for
Brazil's National team captain, and play-maker. If Neymar's mouth-dropping transfer is an outlier, or Paul Pogba's
ninety million pounds of last Summer is any indication of the trend towards unrealistic numbers,
the transfer market will take on the MLB, NHL, and NBA's overblown offseason.

  <h3>The Case for Ryan Kent</h3>
  <p>While the Footballing world got its first glimpse of speedster Ryan Kent, many around
    the Liverpool camp were already privy to his promise. A real handful running at opposition defenders,
    as evidenced by his cameos against Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid in the Audi Cup, Kent's prowess
    and straight-forward style of play can unhinge fullbacks around the planet. Already stocked with speedy
    wingers, Kent will be needed for respite for Mo Salah, and looks suitable for the job at running at players,
    and allowing Firmino, Solanke, and Origi to find space, or make runs off of them. It remains to be seen what
    capacity Jurgen Klopp will utilize young Kent, but he can be a super substitute, not unlike the under-used
    Jordan Ibe, if he continues the style of go-ahead running that Klopp implores in his attackers.
